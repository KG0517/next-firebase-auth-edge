# AuthContext

The library does not come with a client-side code or any built-in authentication context feature. It is up to developer how they will implement user data flow throughout application.

See below for an example `AuthContext`

## Example AuthContext

The following is an example implementation of custom `AuthContext` React context to share user data between server and client components.

```tsx filename="AuthContext.ts"
"use client";

import { createContext, useContext } from "react";
import type { UserInfo } from "firebase/auth";
import { Claims } from "next-firebase-auth-edge/lib/auth/claims";

export interface User extends Omit<UserInfo, "providerId"> {
  emailVerified: boolean;
  customClaims: Claims;
}

export interface AuthContextValue {
  user: User | null;
}

export const AuthContext = createContext<AuthContextValue>({
  user: null,
});

export const useAuth = () => useContext(AuthContext);
```
