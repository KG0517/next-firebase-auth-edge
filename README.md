Next.js Firebase Authentication for Edge and Node.js runtimes. Use Firebase Authentication with latest Next.js features.

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/next-firebase-auth-edge.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/next-firebase-auth-edge)

## Example

The starter demo is available at [next-firebase-auth-edge-starter.vercel.app](https://next-firebase-auth-edge-starter.vercel.app/)

You can find source code for the demo in [examples/next13-typescript-starter](https://github.com/ensite-in/next-firebase-auth-edge/tree/main/examples/next13-typescript-starter)

## Why

Official `firebase-admin` library relies heavily on Node.js internal `crypto` library and primitives that are unavailable inside [Next.js Edge Runtime](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/edge-runtime).

This library aims to solve the problem of creating and verifying custom JWT tokens provided by **Firebase Authentication** using Web Crypto API available inside Edge runtimes.

## Features

`next-firebase-auth-edge` is compatible with latest Next.js features, such as [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) or [Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components)

To allow gradual adoption of latest Next.js features, `next-firebase-auth-edge` works interchangeably with [getServerSideProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props) and legacy [Api Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes)

* **Supports latest Next.js features**
* **Zero-bundle size**
* **Minimal configuration**: In contrary to other libraries, you don't have to define your own API routes or update your `next.config.js` file. All heavy lifting is done by [the middleware](https://next-firebase-auth-edge-docs.vercel.app/docs/usage/middleware).
* **Secure**: Uses [jose](https://github.com/panva/jose) for JWT validation. Signs user cookies with rotating keys to mitigate the risk of cryptanalysis attacks

## Installation

npm install next-firebase-auth-edge
